# Toolchain
My toolchain is the following:
- <a href="https://github.com/ModelioOpenSource/Modelio">Modelio</a>
- <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.dev/">Node.js</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a> for code formatting
- <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> for linting, analysis

The toolchain will be updated by project, not all tools will be used for every project. 

# Projects
<b>Bill and Expenses Web App</b>
- This web app is a tool that tracks users' bills and expenses, keeping them tied to their history. 
- There is an option to download the data as a file.
- Data can be displayed in month-by-month, day-by-day, or year-by-year intervals.
- Has an e-mail service to send users e-mails based on when their bills are due.

<b>Flexulator</b>
- Flexulator is a program I've actually already created, albeit in a state I deem unfinished. 
- It's currently written in Rust and is intended to be used in the command-line.
- However, something I'd like to add is a GUI of some kind. Instead of using flexulator just as a command-line program, I'd like to use it similar to how one uses nano, where you invoke the program and can run prompts into it until you close out of it.

<b>Pion</b>
- Like Flexulator, I've already worked on Pion in the past, however my plans for it weren't too great. 
- Pion is a chess engine, originally written in C++ -- now written in JavaScript. 
- It is intended to be used for single-player usage only, with a minimal UI consisting of a text-box where you can type moves (if you wish) as well as drag-and-drop based control.
